## Installation

**Basic installation, service provider registration, and aliasing:**

To install ActivityLog, make sure "regulus/activity-log" has been added to Laravel 5's `composer.json` file.

	"require": {
		"regulus/activity-log": "0.5.*"
	},

Then run `php composer.phar update` from the command line. Composer will install the ActivityLog package. Now, all you have to do is register the service provider and set up ActivityLog's alias. In `app/config/app.php`, add this to the `providers` array:

	Regulus\ActivityLog\ActivityLogServiceProvider::class,

And add this to the `aliases` array:

	'Activity' => 'Regulus\ActivityLog\Models\Activity',

**Publishing migrations and configuration:**

To publish this package configuration and migrations, run this from the command line:

	php artisan vendor:publish

You will now be able to edit the config file in `config/log.php` if you wish to customize the configuration of ActivityLog.

> **Note:** Migrations are only published; remember to run them when ready.

To run migration to create ActivityLog's table, run this from the command line:

	php artisan migrate

## Basic Usage

**Logging user activity:**

	Activity::log([
		'contentId'   => $user->id,
		'contentType' => 'User',
		'action'      => 'Create',
		'description' => 'Created a User',
		'details'     => 'Username: '.$user->username,
		'updated'     => (bool) $id,
	]);

The above code will log an activity for the currently logged in user. The IP address will automatically be saved as well and the "developer" flag will be set if the user has a "developer" session variable set to true. This can be used to differentiate activities between the developer and the website administrator.
